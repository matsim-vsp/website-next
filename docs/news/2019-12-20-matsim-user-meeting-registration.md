Registration for the user meeting is now open on the [page of the event](/conferences/user_meeting_2020),
until February 27th, 2020.

We encourage you to register at your earliest convenience,
*even if you do not yet know whether you will be able to come*.
This will help make sure we have enough seats and food for all participants,
and you will have the possibility to pay only when you are sure to come.
