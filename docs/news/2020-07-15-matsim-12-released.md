We released MATSim 12.0 last month, bringing various improvements and optimizations
to MATSim.

There were some API changes, e.g. how we handle undefined times. So if you write
code yourself that uses MATSim, you might need to adapt it in some places when upgrading.

[Download](/downloads/) the latest version of MATSim now!
