The video &mdash; make sure to watch it in HD on Vimeo &mdash; shows a sub-sample of 500K agents from the MATSim Germany national scenario for private car travel. The full scenario counts 4 million agents generated from a random realization of the national German travel survey (Mobilit√§t in Deutschland 2008), calibrated against 2500 count stations and OD-flows of navigation devices. The network of major roads (360 K links) as well as more than 4 million activity locations are extracted from openstreetmap.org. The scenario consists of full-day travel plans with activities of type home, work, edu, shop, leisure and miscellaneous.
