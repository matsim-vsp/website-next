The MATSim model of Paris was built by [GeoTwin](https://www.geotwin.io) for the [CityMakers challenge](https://citymakers.io). 
Most of the data sources used for the model are available as OpenData, including network (from OpenStreetMap), population census, commuter matrix and travel diary.

The model covers the city of Paris as well as parts of the surrounding region of ÃŽle-de-France. About 10 mio. people live in the modelled area, of which a 10% sample was simulated.
The model includes private cars, public transport, walk and bike (both teleportation-only), and also includes a fixed taxi-demand as well as freefloating car-sharing as
technical proof-of-concepts for the aforementioned challenge.

The model will be improved and expanded in the future to allow the planning of sophisticated new mobility patterns.
