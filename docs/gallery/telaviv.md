The MATSim model for Tel Aviv, Israel, was built for a study exploring the possibility of integrating an operational activity-based model and a dynamic traffic assignment framework. It generates the travel demand directly from an activity-based model generated for the Tel Aviv area, without falling back to OD matrices. The Tel Aviv activity-based model system comprises a hierarchy of logit and nested logit models for the main stop of a tour, while intermediate stops are modeled conditionally on the basis of the main stop. The primary data source is the Israel National Travel Habits Survey from 1996. The network used was converted from a static EMME/2 model which exists for the modeled region.

In the future, the model will be updated with improved secondary activity locations (shown last in the video) and location choice will be enabled in the simulation in order to try to achieve better travel time and travel distance distributions for secondary activities.
