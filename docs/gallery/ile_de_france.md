The MATSim model of Île-de-France is open and reproducible. It is based entirely on open data and open software and can therefore be used by any researcher to start analyses on the synthetic population itself or on downstream MATSim simulations.

The methodology is documented in detail in the following publication:

> Hörl, S. and M. Balac (2021) [Synthetic population and travel demand for Paris and Île-de-France based on open and publicly available data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21003016), _Transportation Research Part C_, **130**, 103291.

Instructions on how to reproduce and run the simulations are available online on [Github: An open synthetic population of Île-de-France](https://github.com/eqasim-org/ile-de-france).

While the scenario covers the Île-de-France region around Paris, it can easily be adapted to other regions and cities of France. First attempts have been made for Toulouse and Lille.
