# 2016: MATSim class at TU Berlin (matsim version 0.8.x)

This is a summary of tutorials of the MATSim class at TU Berlin which is held 
each year during the summer term. The tutorials provide a step-by-step 
installation and usage guide for creating your own scenario and policy cases. 
It does not always go too much into detail (as it is usually taught in a 
very responsive way in a classroom), so if you need more details about a 
certain topic, please also consult the [MATSim book](/the-book). All code 
snippets in this tutorial are direct links to the GitHub repository 
of MATSim release 0.8.0 (June 2016).

**It is not recommended to use any other MATSim version with this tutorial.**

Access: The tutorial lies within TU Berlin's e-learning system ISIS but is open for guests.
