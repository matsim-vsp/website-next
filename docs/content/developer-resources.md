# Developer Resources

Below is a list of several links that contain information about the development process 
of MATSim. Some of the linked pages may be useful, while others are just "for fun". 
Most of the pages are updated once a day during the night.


## [Build Server](http://ci.matsim.org:8080/)

The MATSim Build Server (sometimes also called "Continuous Integration Server") regularly 
checks out the source code of MATSim, compiles the code and runs the tests. 
The build server has detailed statistics about the code and tests.

## [Issue Tracker](/issuetracker)

Found a bug? Then file a bug-report! Have a feature request? Enter it here! 
Nothing to do anymore? Fix a bug or implement a feature request!

## [Javadoc](/javadoc)

## [Doxygen](/doxygen)

## [Test results archive](https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/testresults/)

We regularly archive some test results, such as plots of fundamental diagrams.
