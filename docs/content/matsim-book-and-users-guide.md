# MATSim Book and User's Guide

The [MATSim book](/the-book) is a comprehensive introduction into MATSim.  
Since books are a bit static, and software is dynamic, we provide an 
[extract of some chapters as a user's guide](http://matsim.org/docs/userguide). 
In contrast to the book, these chapters are regularly updated in conjunction 
with our annual MATSim class at TU Berlin, running from March until July every year.
