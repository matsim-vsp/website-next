# MATSim Example Project

There is a [MATSim example project on GitHub](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-example-project).  
It allows to use all of the matsim main distribution as well as the contribs as maven-includes.  
The setup allows both release versions and nightly snapshot version.  
It is almost certainly the best way to go if you are somewhat familiar with maven and 
want to program against MATSim (i.e. use matsim as a library).
