The MATSim Book is the official reference and user documentation for MATSim.

### Topics Covered

The book is divided into four parts, covering a broad range of topics on more than 600 pages:

- Part I is an introduction on how to use MATSim, using only the functionality that MATSim brings out-of-the-box.
- Part II first explains the different data sets needed to run MATSim, and then introduces a number of extensions which add additional functionality to MATSim.
- Part III provides a lot of insight into the theoretical background of MATSim.
- Part IV finally presents over 40 use cases from around the world where MATSim was or still is used.
