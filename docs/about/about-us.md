### MATSim Community

MATSim is currently a joint effort by various groups and persons.

The two main drivers for the development of MATSim are:

- [Transport Systems Planning and Transport Telematics](http://www.vsp.tu-berlin.de/) at the Institute for Land and Sea Transport Systems, Technische Universität Berlin, led by Prof. Dr. Kai Nagel
- [Transport Planning](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/vpl/) at the Institute for Transport Planning and Systems (IVT), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, led by Prof. Dr. Kay W. Axhausen

In addition, the following groups and companies contribute regularly, or have so in the past, to the development of MATSim:

- [Senozon](https://senozon.com/), a company in Switzerland with subsidiaries in Germany and Austria, founded by former PhD and research students.
- [Simunto](https://simunto.com/), another company in Switzerland, founded by a former PhD and research student.
- [Center for Transport Development](http://www.up.ac.za/en/centre-for-transport-development/) at the University of Pretoria, especially the group led by Prof. Dr. Johan Joubert.
- [Future Cities Laboratory](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch), part of the Singapore-ETH Centre.
- [Department of Transport Systems](http://www.dts.put.poznan.pl/) at Poznan University of Technology (Poland), especially Michał Maciejewski.

In addition, we stay in close contact to other research groups using and extending MATSim, for example in Toronto (Canada), KIT Karlsruhe and DLR Berlin (both Germany).
After all, MATSim is an open source project, feel free to join us on user meetings, conferences or submit patches and pull requests to gain some glory within the MATSim community!

While the development is mostly advanced by current research projects, there is a MATSim Committee that acts as a steering group for organizational and strategic issues.
