### Agent-Based Transport Simulations

MATSim provides a framework to implement large-scale agent-based transport simulations. The framework consists of several modules which can be combined or used stand-alone. Modules can be replaced by custom implementations to test single aspects of your own work.

Currently, MATSim offers a framework for demand-modeling, agent-based mobility-simulation (traffic flow simulation), re-planning, a controler to iteratively run simulations as well as methods to analyze the output generated by the modules.
