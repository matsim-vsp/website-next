# IDE Configuration

MATSim is developed by several persons on different platforms. So we need a basic set of settings to work successfully together.
Namely, source code files should use UTF-8 as encoding and Unix-style line endings.

## Eclipse

### Text File Encoding

In the Eclipse Preferences, please set the Text File Encoding to "UTF-8", and 
the New Text File Line Delimiter to "Unix" (in General > Workspace).
