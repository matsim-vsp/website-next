# Using Eclipse

The following sections explain how to install and setup Eclipse Mars (4.5, released June 2015) or newer to work with MATSim.
 
## Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed and ready to use:

- **Java 11 or newer**  
  To use MATSim, you need to have a Java SDK (JDK) installed and not only a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Best is to download and install JDK 11 from [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net).
- **Eclipse**  
  Download Eclipse from [eclipse.org](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), the package "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is enough for MATSim. Unzip the downloaded file and place it on some suitable location on your harddisk. Eclipse does not require any special installation. Experience shows that on Windows it's best to install Eclipse at a location that does not require administrative rights.
- **Configure Eclipse**  
  Use [UTF8 as File-Encoding](/docs/devguide/ide-configuration).
- **Make sure Eclipse is running from a JDK**  
  [Configure Eclipse to use a JDK](/docs/devguide/eclipse/jdk)
 

## Cloning the MATSim project to Eclipse

"Cloning" refers to the task of getting a copy of the MATSim source code from the 
server that keeps the most current and official source code version. The copy will 
be placed on your computer and allows you to work with the source code. To clone 
the MATSim source code to your computer, start Eclipse, then:

- choose menu `File > Importâ€¦`, and there `Git > Projects from Git`. Click `Next`.

- select `Clone URI` and click `Next`.

- Enter the following URI: `https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim.git`.

- Choose the `master` branch and click `Next`.

- Specify a location on your computer, where the source code should be saved. 
Eclipse makes a suggestion on where to put the data. It's okay to use that, but 
make sure you'll remember the location as we will need it later again!

- When you click on `Next`, Eclipse will start downloading the source code. 
Depending on your internet connection, this may take some minutes.
 
- After all the source code has been downloaded, Eclipse will ask you how to 
import the source code. Choose `Import as general project` and click `Next`.

- Name the project `matsim-all`. Important: Name it `matsim-all`, and not just "matsim" as proposed!

- You should now end up with a project `matsim-all` in Eclipse.
 
- Choose menu `File` > `Import`, then `Maven > Existing Maven Projects`. Click `Next`.

- Navigate to the directory, where you stored the MATSim source code (see some steps 
above). Once you've selected the right directory, it should list the matsim project, 
and all the contribs. Select the matsim project and those 
contribs that you need. If you are unsure, just start with the 
matsim project. These last two steps can be repeated any time when you need additional 
contrib.

- Click on `Finish`. Eclipse will now add the selected parts as projects to 
Eclipse. Depending on the number of contribs you selected, this might take a moment.
