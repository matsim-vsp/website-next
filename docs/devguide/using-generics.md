# Using Generics


Generics can be quite powerful, but also very cumbersome if used wrongly. Thus, respect the following rules:

- Using Generics: that's okay, e.g. when using the Java collection classes
- Providing Generics (i.e. introducing Generics in our own classes): only sparingly 
if you know exactly what you do. If you are not sure, do not use Generics!
