The MATSim community has developed several analysis tools, everything from programming language libraries, to open-source results viewers, to commercial software packages.

This list is not exhaustive, nor is it a recommendation for your use case! If you know of something we've missed, let us know.

## Python: matsim-tools

A semi-official Python package developed at VSP TU Berlin is available at:

- https://pypi.org/project/matsim-tools/

Its main function is to allow python developers to read and process MATSim simulation outputs.

It currently reads MATSim networks in several formats and can iterate through population/plans files. More to come.

## R: matsim-r library

A semi-official Python package developed at VSP TU Berlin is now under development as well. It is not on CRAN yet because it is still early days. But you can follow along at

- https://github.com/matsim-vsp/matsim-r

and you can install it directly into R with:

```r
# If you don't already have devtools:
install.packages("devtools")
# and then:
devtools::install_github("matsim-vsp/matsim-r")
```
