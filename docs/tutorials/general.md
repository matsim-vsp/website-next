# General Tutorials

Keeping a certain tutorial up to date has proven infeasible.  Two main problems are:

- Different teachers/tutors have different styles, and thus have difficulties upgrading someone else's tutorial.
- Different tutorials cover different parts of the material, and so the upgrade of "the" standard tutorial always was inconsistent between its different pieces.

We are now aiming for the following:

- The standard intro reference is "[The Book](/the-book)".
- TU Berlin teaches a MATSim class during every summer term.  
We plan to move the tutorial material of that class to the site 
here at the end of each term (i.e. around July/August of every year). 
[The most current version is the 2020 course](/content/2020-matsim-class-tu-berlin-matsim-version-12x).

Additional material is available under [matsim.org/javadoc](/javadoc) --> main distribution --> tutorials.  
That material may be a bit more difficult to find or read, but it has the advantage 
that it is inside the code repository and thus always 
compiling and in many cases even secured by a regression test.
